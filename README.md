## 1.0 TITLE OF THE PROJECT

- Foodies & Co

## 2.0 INTRODUCTION
Foodies & Co is an innovative web application designed to streamline and simplify food and beverage operations for businesses. Built using the Laravel Model, View and Controller (MVC) framework, Foodies & Co offers a user-friendly platform for buyers and sellers to perform buying and selling operations.

## 3.0 OBJECTIVES
There are three main objectives of our project:
- To provide a user-friendly ordering process. The interface of the application will be simple and minimalist. This is to make sure that users can easily select food and drinks and add them to the cart. This is to ensure that the ordering process is straightforward, with clear instructions and the most important thing is that the application just only requires minimal steps for users to complete an order.
- To develop an efficient order management system. This involves creating a back-end functionality that allows restaurant staff to receive and process orders effectively. We will implement features such as real-time order notifications and order tracking. The goal is to streamline the order flow, minimise errors, and ensure timely delivery or pickup.
- To ensure that the application that we will develop could be accessible across many types of devices including desktops, tablets, ipads and smartphones. The ideal is to make sure that the application gives a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes so that the user can access on any types of devices.

## 4.0 FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY 
There are several functions that we will implement on our project:
* User Registration and Authentication: allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
* Shopping Cart: enable users to view their selected items, modify quantities and remove items if they have changed their mind.
* Payment Integration: integrate a secure payment gateway to process online payments so that users can complete transactions using various payment methods such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or online banking.
* Order Tracking: implement a feature that allows users to track the status of their orders.
* User Reviews and Ratings: allow users to leave feedback and ratings for the food they have ordered, and the important thing is to help future customers make decisions.

For the first time user, they need to click on the “Register” button and register their account first. For the regular user that has already created an account, they just need to click on “Login” button.
