## 1.0 TITLE OF THE PROJECT

- Foodies & Co

## 2.0 INTRODUCTION
Foodies & Co is an innovative web application designed to streamline and simplify food and beverage operations for businesses. Built using the Laravel Model, View and Controller (MVC) framework, Foodies & Co offers a user-friendly platform for buyers and sellers to perform buying and selling operations.

## 3.0 OBJECTIVES
There are three main objectives of our project:
- To provide a user-friendly ordering process. The interface of the application will be simple and minimalist. This is to make sure that users can easily select food and drinks and add them to the cart. This is to ensure that the ordering process is straightforward, with clear instructions and the most important thing is that the application just only requires minimal steps for users to complete an order.
- To develop an efficient order management system. This involves creating a back-end functionality that allows restaurant staff to receive and process orders effectively. We will implement features such as real-time order notifications and order tracking. The goal is to streamline the order flow, minimise errors, and ensure timely delivery or pickup.
- To ensure that the application that we will develop could be accessible across many types of devices including desktops, tablets, ipads and smartphones. The ideal is to make sure that the application gives a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes so that the user can access on any types of devices.

## 4.0 FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY 
There are several functions that we will implement on our project:
* User Registration and Authentication: allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
* Shopping Cart: enable users to view their selected items, modify quantities and remove items if they have changed their mind.
* Payment Integration: integrate a secure payment gateway to process online payments so that users can complete transactions using various payment methods such as credit/debit cards, digital wallets, or online banking.
* Order Tracking: implement a feature that allows users to track the status of their orders.
* User Reviews and Ratings: allow users to leave feedback and ratings for the food they have ordered, and the important thing is to help future customers make decisions.

## 8.0 WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTIES TO DEVELOP THE APPLICATION

Particularly for developers who are new to the framework, in this case us students, laravel has a steep learning curve. It has a vast ecosystem of features, libraries, and concepts to comprehend. To fully comprehend the architectural patterns, best practices, and conventions of Laravel, developers must devote time and effort.

- Configuring the development environment, including installing PHP and a web server (such as Apache), is necessary for setting up a Laravel application. For us novices, correctly configuring these components can be quite challenging.

- Understanding software architecture principles is quite challenging for us because it is necessary for creating a well-structured and easy-to-maintain Laravel application. When dealing with complex business logic, designing a clear separation of concerns and managing dependencies is quite challenging.

- Testing the website can help us avoid any regression and ensure code quality and this is encouraged by laravel itself. However, when dealing with complex interactions between various application components, writing effective tests and setting up testing environments can be difficult for us, who are just starting to learn about laravel.

- Other than that, we also encounter some problems trying to make the order status page, where the user can see their order status whether it is still being prepared or has been delivered.
